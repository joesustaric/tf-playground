# About
Just me messing around with TF

I want to attempt...

- [ ] Create a AWS VPC including multi AZ private and public subnets
- [ ] Bastion box to access VPC
- [ ] ECS cluster
.. maybe more.



Also attempt similar as above but maybe for GCP..

Also Playing with https://www.checkov.io/  
install `pip install checkov`

This also uses `asdf-vm` for version management.

## Using 
terraform  
aws-vault  
chekov

## Setup

1. Install Terraform. `brew install terraform`
2. Tab auto completion `terraform -install-autocomplete`
3. install checkov `pip install checkov`


## Terraform Setup
`terraform init`
